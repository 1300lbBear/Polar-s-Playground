❄️ Polar’s Playground Community Project

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for our latest Garry's Mod adventure — a labor of love forged by the players, creators, and chaos-bringers of Polar’s Playground!

🌟 What is This?

This project is a collaborative community effort designed to bring new, fun, and unforgettable gameplay experiences to our GMod server. Whether it's custom gamemodes, unique NPC behavior, intricate stat systems, or purely ridiculous features — it all begins right here, with us.

At its heart, this project is a sandbox of ideas: some wild, some genius, all driven by the creativity of our members. Everyone from seasoned Lua devs to first-time scripters and idea-havers are welcome.

🤝 Community First

The code, features, and content you see here are the result of passion-fueled collaboration. We encourage open discussion, wild suggestions, and constructive feedback. Whether you’re scripting Nextbots, dreaming up mechanics, making sprites, or just have a really cool idea — you belong here.

This is more than just a repository. It's our shared canvas.

📌 Our Vision

"Built by the community, for the community."

Our goal is to create a living, breathing world of systems and gameplay loops that reflect the spirit of Polar’s Playground: fun, freedom, and a little bit of madness. From PvE raids to sandbox utilities, everything here is in motion — and you're invited to be part of it.

Stay Cool. Stay Creative. Thanks for being part of the ride — we can't wait to see what you build.

– Polar 💙
